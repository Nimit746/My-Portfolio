# 🚀 Nimit Gupta's Portfolio

> “I build. I design. I deploy. I evolve.”

A sleek, dynamic, and full-stack **developer portfolio** built with the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), styled with **Tailwind CSS**, and powered by modern libraries like **Lucide React**, **React Icons**, and **Axios**.  
This project isn't just a portfolio — it's a statement of capability, modular thinking, and aesthetic precision.
